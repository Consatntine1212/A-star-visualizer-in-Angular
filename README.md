# A* Path Visualizer

## Overview

The A* Path Visualizer is an Angular app that demonstrates the A* pathfinding algorithm in a grid-based environment. It allows you to visualize how the algorithm finds the shortest path from a start point to an end point while avoiding obstacles.

## Features

- Interactive grid for setting start/end points and obstacles.
- Real-time pathfinding visualization.
- Configurable settings for algorithm behavior.

## How to Use

1. **Visit the Deployed App:** [Open the A* Path Visualizer](https://a-star-visualizer-in-angular.vercel.app/home).
2. Click to set the start and end points on the grid.
3. Place obstacles by clicking on the grid.
4. Click "Start" to see the pathfinding in action.
